# Project -1 : Python Turtle Etch-a-Sketch
 ![DD](https://github.com/Himel-Sarder/Python-Turtle-Projects/assets/143216886/3cf424e5-6e2d-4857-b8c5-181003d64c9b)

This Python script implements a simple Etch-a-Sketch application using the Turtle graphics library. The app allows users to draw lines on a canvas using keyboard controls.

## Features:

- Move the turtle forward: 'Right' arrow key
- Move the turtle backward: 'Left' arrow key
- Turn the turtle left: 'Up' arrow key
- Turn the turtle right: 'Down' arrow key
- Clear the canvas: 'c' key

## Usage:

1. Install Python if you haven't already (https://www.python.org/).
2. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the script.
4. Run the script using Python:

   ```
   python Etch a Sketch app.py
   ```

5. Use the arrow keys to control the turtle and draw on the canvas.
6. Press the 'c' key to clear the canvas and start over.

## Overview

The Spirograph project is a Python Turtle program that generates mesmerizing spirograph patterns on the screen. Using simple mathematical calculations and the Turtle graphics library, this project creates colorful and intricate designs resembling classic spirograph art.

## Features

- **Colorful Patterns**: The program draws spirograph patterns with a variety of vibrant colors, creating visually stunning designs.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Users can adjust parameters such as the radius and gap to create different sizes and complexities of spirograph patterns.
- **Interactive Interface**: The program runs in a Turtle graphics window, allowing users to watch the patterns being drawn in real-time and interact with the drawing process.


## Requirements:

- Python 3.x
- Turtle graphics library (included in standard Python distribution)
